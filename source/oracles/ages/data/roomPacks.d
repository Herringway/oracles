//; Each byte is for a room in the present or past.
//;
//; Bits 0-6 represent the id of the room "pack". Rooms in the same pack have
//; compatible graphics. Rooms in a different pack may need a full graphics
//; reload in screen transitions, in the form of a "fadeout" transition. This
//; might be used more in Seasons, in Ages almost everything is in pack $01.
//;
//; Value $7f has some special behaviour. Dunno what it does but it's used in the
//; animal companion region.
//;
//; When bit 7 is set, the graphics must be reloaded when you leave the room
//; pack. So the maku tree has bit 7 set and is in room pack $00. So when you go
//; to any adjacent room, which are in a different pack ($01), the graphics will
//; be fully reloaded.
